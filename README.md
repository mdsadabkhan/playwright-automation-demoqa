3. Fixtures & Hooks – Centralized setup/teardown for consistent test execution

4. Environment-Specific Configurations – Using .env.test (can be extended for staging, prod, etc.)

5. Test Data Management – JSON-based test data injection for easy maintenance

6. Allure Reporting – Rich, interactive test execution reports

7. Cross-Browser Support – Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

8. Mobile Emulation – Execute tests in mobile viewports

9. Scalable Architecture – Built for team collaboration and CI/CD pipelines
